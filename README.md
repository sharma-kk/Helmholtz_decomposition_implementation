# Helmholtz_decomposition_implementation
According to the Helmholtz decompostion theorem we can split a vector field into its divergence-free and curl-free components. 
We do this numerically here. 
We take a vector field and calculate its div-free and curl-free components. 

Observations: If i take 'CG' 1 finite element space instead 2 then the solution is not very accurate. at present the divergence is of the order 10^-6 
comparison to theoretical value of the order 10^-11
